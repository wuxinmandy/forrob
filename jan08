In 2024, to promote the EE engineer culture throughout the company and provide a better display platform for all inner source projects, we initiated Project A. This is a project developed by a virtual team, whose members are mainly those from Shanghai and Dalian who identify with and are enthusiastic about the EE culture and inner source culture. The project was initiated by MM and XX, and the virtual team was led by AA and BB. After a year of hard work, the first version of the portal was successfully launched in November. Through this portal, all developers can learn about the brief introduction and specific details of each ongoing inner source project, as well as the specific code submission status. This platform can attract more colleagues across the company to contribute more projects. Certainly, this is just the beginning. In 2025, we will continue to improve this platform and provide more abundant functions. Stay tuned.
